### Choose the Right Frame Rate

24 FPS: The previous standard for films and cinematic videos.

30 FPS: Most online content.

60 FPS: Ideal for fast paced scenarios where it is required to capture sharper details.

120 FPS: Used for creating slow-motion effects, allowing for extreme slow-down while maintaining smooth playback.

### Challenges

- File Size and Bandwidth
- Playback Compatibility
