# Explain like I'm 5

#### If you can't explain it to a child, you don't truly understand it - Naval Ravikant

During a workshop conducted at ITV offices, we explored the concepts surrounding video streaming and how they could be explained in the simplest possible terms. We decided to create examples that could be used to explain those concepts to a 5 year old.

## Client Side vs Server Side Adverts
- Think of a picture book versus a blank drawing book.

- A picture book has some form of a diagram pre-populated which makes drawing/coloring easier however it limits your creative freedom.

- A drawing book allows you to draw whatever you like without any guardrails.

## Feature Flags (Launch Darkly)
- Mr.Potato head allows you to customize what is currently being displayed. Want to add ears for a bit? Add ears. Want to add a hat to see if it looks good? Add a hat.

- Launch Darkly is a service that allows you to toggle various features on and off.

## Video Players (Shaka / Theo / XDK)
- Imagine you’re trying to draw a picture on your iPad - XDK provides a set of brushes and colors you can use and limits what options you have available.

- Shaka/Theo can be configured so that you have a broader variety of brushes / colors / visual effects.

## Transcoding
- Imagine taking a large comic book and cutting it up into small snippets to put into newspapers.

- You can change content from high resolution to low resolution, change the format, or the language based on what the audience need.

- You can even folding something to fit it into a smaller space.

## Analytics (PES)
- A friend is watching you complete a task, ad they keep an eye on how you’re doing so that can help if something goes wrong.

## Variants
- People with different sized feet need different sized shoes.

- If you give an adult a children’s shoe, they wont be able to wear it - so we need to tailor things to the client's needs.

- You also get different kinds of footwear depending on what you're doing - going outside (e.g. mobile), slippers for inside (e.g. CTV).

## Digital Rights Management (DRM)
- Imagine you’re writing in your personal diary.. depending on what you’ve written, you may decide to protect it so that nobody else can read what you’ve written. 
    - Diary with no lock
    - Diary with a passcode/key
    - Diary with a passcode/key which is then locked in a safe.

- Coded messages can only be read by the person they’re intended for.

## Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- Picture an ice cream factory that needs to distribute the ice cream to vans where people can purchase it. Large trucks can carry more efficiently (size of trucks - bandwidth).

- Ice cream can be stored in the local distribution to the customer.

- Ice cream vans drive around and deliver to customers.

- If the ice cream melts then it’s taken too long (latency).
